# Introspection 




### Why must we choose you? 

At first I started learning coding I really liked it, I used to spend most of the my free time coding as I found it very interesting. In my school days I started learning HTML coding as it was a part of my syllabus. With the assist of my father I learned Oracle SQL , C and python programming.I'd also say that I am a quick learner and with the assist of amfoss club teaching and exposure to various platforms I'd learn many things and hope to achieve a few milestones


### What is your plan for the next 6 months? 
 
 For the next 6 months I'd 1st like to explore popular programming languages and learn them, as it would be helpfull in my future.Then I want to train myself for various competitions like hackathons or GSOC etc.I'm sure with the assist of amfoss club I can improve my coding skills at a good rate.
 
 
## How would you contribute back to the club? 

If I get selected to be a part of the amfoss club I'd not be lazy and put my efforts & time in completing the works assigned to my at the earliest, also I would assist my fellow clubmates in any way I can.


## Do you have any feedback for the selection process? 

Its a great process to motivate students to explore new things and learn many things by ourselves. The tasks are not too hard as we could complete them from the few tips and help provided by you and also with the help of google.
