I took my time for dual booting Ubuntu and windows as I have a important data in my laptop so I've watched a couple of videoa of how they dual boot and read reviews and blogs of people who have already dual booted their laptops.Afer all this I've started the proccess of dual booting watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKn5U2esuRk). I cleared 80gb in my disk and created and bootable disk and installed Linux in my laptop.
